## Web development 2. â€“ Practice 10.

1. Extend the family budget application with the following functionalities:

    - a. Add a new budget item to the list!

        - Create the form.
        - Validate the data.
        - Save it to the `budget` table.
        - On success redirect the page to the listing page.

    - b. Add authentication to the page

        - Create the `users` table.
        - Create the registration form and save the registered user to the `users` table.
        - Create the login form based on the information of the `users` table.
        - Make the list page protected, which means, only those are allowed to access it who are already logged in.
        - Show the logged in user's username.
        - Create a logout link and a logout functionality, which redirects to the login page.
        - Modify the `budget` table: store the appropriate user information for every budget item (extend the table with a `user_id` field).
        - List only those items which belong to the logged in user.
        - When adding a new item, save also the user information to the item.
