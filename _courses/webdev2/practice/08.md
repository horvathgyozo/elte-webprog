## Web development 2. â€“ Practice 07.

1. In valid HTML page

    a. write `"Hello world!"`!
    b. write `"Hello name'"`, where `name` is coming from a variable containing your name!

2. Calculate and write to the page the factorial of a number. The calculating code should be encapsulated in a function.

3. An array of error messages is given. Show the error messages as a list on the page!

4. On a film listing page we would like to select the category of the film from a dropdown list. But the server needs the id of the category and not its text. For example: 5 - Action, 4 - Drama, 8 - Comedy. Find a data structure for representing the data, and generate the appropriate dropdown list!

5. Products with id and title are given (e.g. 23 - pendrive). Show the products as a radio group on the page!

6. In a catalogue we store the name, neptun id, year of birth and sex for every student.
